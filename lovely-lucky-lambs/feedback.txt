I just finished the Lovely Lucky LAMBs challenge.
It seems that in the test cases, there is a bug in the calculation of
the special case generous distribution (e.g. when total_labs is 223). 
For paying the senior-most henchman in the generous distribution of such
a case, the sum of the LAMBs given to the next two subordinates should be 
less than or equal to the remaining number of LAMBs, not strictly less
than. Thanks for adding a feedback command!
